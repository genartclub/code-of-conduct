# Invitations

Personal recommendations and invitations are a critical part of how we balance inclusivity with exclusivity. There is a responsibility to all members when you invite someone in. As a layer of assurance, there is a checklist to fill out when inviting.

Every member has the power to send out invites. We value inclusivity, and encourage everyone to invite people that are unlike themselves in some way.

Thank you for enriching genartclub!
